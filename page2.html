            Digital projects can fail due to cost cutting approaches by allocating insufficient and small budgets which can result in less skilled projects. For successful projects it is good to have a team including business analysts, developers, testers and project managers.
            Lack of proper planning results in projects failing as many IT projects are started without a proper understanding of the business scope and desired project outcome.
            Successful projects must produce the desired outcome within targeted time and budget.
            Without proper planning a number of problems can occur including unclear scope and objectives, confusion about responsibilities and roles, resources underutilised, resources not available at critical times, uneven workloads for a team, project running over time, project being over budget and poor performance.
            Technology must be selected wisely to prevent technical failures of the project, if the Hardware and Software is wrong the project will fail.
            Some project managers chose a programming language because of personal preference or what is a new trend but they must make sure the technology fits with the business purpose.
            Projects can technically fail if a programming language, development environment or operating environment are not aligning with the business need.

            Business must ensure they don't keep more information than is necessary and remove any data that is not being used.
            Clean up processes should be created to ensure unnecessary personal data is not stored and is deleted instead.
            Security measures must be put in place when dealing with personal data such as encryption and firewalls to prevent hackers from obtaining data.
