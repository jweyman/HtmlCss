You could improve efficiency by tracking and trying to limit how much time you spend on a specific task.
There are tools you can put on your PC like “Rescue Time” which can let you know how much time you have spent on daily tasks like email, word processing and apps.
Taking regular breaks helps to maintain constant performance and improve concentration.
Setting self-imposed deadlines for each of your tasks enables you to be more focused.
It's important not to be too much of a perfectionist. It is better to do the task to the best of your ability and move on rather than spending too much time trying to make it perfect. You can always come back to a task and improve it if necessary.
