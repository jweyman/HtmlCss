UK Law states that a website should be made accessible to disabled users.
If your website does not confirm to certain design standards you could be sued for discrimination.
The Royal National Institute for the Blind has initiated legal action against companies in 2 cases.
Companies need to make sure they are not discriminating against the blind as any court case action could damage their reputation.
Visually impaired people can use a screen reader to translate the contents of web pages using speech synthesisers or Braille displays. If alt attributes are not added to all images tags the user would find it hard to understand what is on the page.
