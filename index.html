        <div class="box box2"><h1> Welcome to Jeremy Weyman's Website</h1> </div>
        <div class="box box3"> I have Advanced level training in Information Technology and gained a BTEC National Diploma in Computer studies from Southampton City college in 2001.
            After leaving college I have gained over 15 years experience in various roles within Information Technology including
            Technical support analyst providing global support to over 1500 users
            Experience within IT Production, building upgrading, repairing and software loading of PCs, laptops and Servers.
            On the CV link in the top bar menu I have attached a copy of my CV which you can view in a pdf
            <p>
            For the past 2 years I have took a career break from working within IT due to becoming a full time career for my Father. 
            As my Fathers health has significantly improved I feel it is the right time to go back in to full time employment.
            While I was looking for opportunities to get back in to the Information Technology sector I come across the Code Nation boot camp
            and thought it would be a good opportunity to change career from IT support to software development as I have allays had an interest in Web design and computer programming. 
            In my spare time I like to go on walks inthe countryside with my 2 dog's. I also help out with my freinds Pug rescue charity designing all the posters for events, helping out with events and help with home checks and rehoming of Pug's
