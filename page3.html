        I am happy with using visual studio code because you can use it to write various different types of code without the need of having different software installed. I like that I can edit HTML, CSS and Javascript files at the same time and easily copy and paste code between different windows.
        IntelliSense is a good feature in visual studio as when you type in code it predicts what you are going to type and gives you various suggestions for tags or elements.
        Tag elements automatically close which makes coding easier so you don't accidentally forget to close a tag.
        I like the colour picker in VS code as it makes it easy to edit the appearance of a website.
        Visual studio makes it easy to create, edit and save HTML pages.

    Trello was a good tool to use when planning the project as I can easily see what I need to do for the assignment and can move items in progress to see what I'm currently working on.
    Once I have completed a task I can then move it to the Done section.
    Visual Studio was the best tool to use as it's an industry standard tool for creating HTML and CSS files.

        I am happy with my project but only had a limited time on the course to answer all the questions for the assignment as well as learning the code and then creating a website from what I have learnt.
        If I could change the website I would have put in buttons instead of text hyper links.
        I would of also put in some interactive content like a game if I had more time
