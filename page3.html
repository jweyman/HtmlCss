        I am happy with using visual studio code because you can use it to write various different types of code without the need of having different software installed. I like that I can edit HTML, CSS and Javascript files at the same time and easily copy and paste code between different windows.
        IntelliSense is a good feature in visual studio as when you type in code it predicts what you are going to type and gives you various suggestions for tags or elements.
        Tag elements automatically close which makes coding easier so you don't accidentally forget to close a tag.
        I like the colour picker in VS code as it makes it easy to edit the appearance of a website.
        Visual studio makes it easy to create, edit and save HTML pages.

    Trello was a good tool to use when planning the project as I can easily see what I need to do for the assignment and can move items in progress to see what I'm currently working on.
    Once I have completed a task I can then move it to the Done section.
    Visual Studio was the best tool to use as it's an industry standard tool for creating HTML and CSS files.

        I am happy with my project but only had a limited time on the course to answer all the questions for the assignment as well as learning the code and then creating a website from what I have learnt.
        If I could change the website I would have put in buttons instead of text hyper links.
        I would of also put in some interactive content like a game if I had more time

         If the course was done in the code nation building it would have been easier to share ideas with the other students as you can easily look at each other's computers and ask other people for help easier. It is a bit more difficult to communicate over slack and zoom to share ideas.

        You could improve efficiency by tracking and trying to limit how much time you spend on a specific task.
        There are tools you can put on your PC like “Rescue Time” which can let you know how much time you have spent on daily tasks like email, word processing and apps.
        Taking regular breaks helps to maintain constant performance and improve concentration.
        Setting self-imposed deadlines for each of your tasks enables you to be more focused.
        It's important not to be too much of a perfectionist. It is better to do the task to the best of your ability and move on rather than spending too much time trying to make it perfect. You can always come back to a task and improve it if necessary.

        Next time when implementing a digital project I would brainstorm ideas in a team on how to best implement the project. I would also spend more time looking at different website’s on the internet for inspiration.
